## Install Manjaro
---
There are many different ways to install Manjaro and the process depends heavily from your current hardware. If you want more detailed steps, you will find them in our [user guide](/support/userguide/). Here we will give you a rough outline how to install Manjaro.

| <img class="icon" src="/img/actions/install.svg">  | **1. Start the installer** |
|                                             | If you boot into the live-system, there's a welcome-window that has an option "Install" or "Installation using Calamares". Click on this option to start the installer. |
|                                             | If you closed the welcome-window, you can find it in the application menu as "Manjaro Welcome". |
| <img class="icon" src="/img/actions/settings.svg">  | **2. Put in your data** |
|                                             | Insert your timezone, preferred keyboard layout and language. |
| <img class="icon" src="/img/actions/partition.svg">  | **3. Determine where Manjaro should be installed** |
|                                             | If you use a virtual machine or want to wipe your whole system (keep in mind that if you use a virtual machine, you only wipe the machine, not your actual computer) choose "erase disk". |
|                                             | Otherwise the installer offers plenty of options such as installing Manjaro alongside your current operating system. Experienced users also can partition manually. |
|                                             | We recommend to take a look at the [user guide](/support/userguide/) and our [wiki](https://wiki.manjaro.org/index.php?title=BIOS_and_UEFI) to make sure that nothing goes wrong. Also we recommend to make backups of your important data before installing Manjaro. You can do this directly in the live-environment if you forgot it.   |
| <img class="icon" src="/img/try/install.svg">  | **4. Finish the installation** |
|                                             | • Insert your account data and wait until the installation is finished. You can use the live-environment while doing an installation to maybe watch some videos or browsing the web.|
|                                             | • Restart your machine |

Congratulations! You have now installed Manjaro.

|---|---|
| **Live-Environment / Live-System**  | Manjaro and many other Linux distributions allow running the system directly from a USB-Drive or DVD.<br/>Those "Live-Enviroments" are completely functional systems and can be used as portable operating-system or to rescue data if something went wrong.  |
