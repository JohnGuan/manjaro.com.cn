## Different ways to try Manjaro
---

To try out Manjaro, you can either directly load it from a DVD or USB-Drive or use a  [virtual machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine) if you are unsure or want to be able to use your current operating-system without [dual-booting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-booting). Here you can find a list of all options you have and their pros and cons.

|                                                | + Experiment without modifying your current setup |
|                                                | + Work parallel with Manjaro and your current system |
|                                                | - Manjaro runs slower due to emulation |
|                                                | - Emulation needs many system resources |
