## Introduction
---

Here are some first steps after you [downloaded](/download) Manjaro. This guide covers only the basic steps, so if you want more information look into the [Manjaro User Guide](/support/userguide/) or the [Manjaro Wiki](https://wiki.manjaro.org/).

So you downloaded Manjaro as an ISO file. An ISO file contains all files Manjaro needs to start an installation compressed into a handy file, which you can then use to make a [DVD](https://wiki.manjaro.org/index.php?title=Burn_an_ISO_File) or [USB-Stick](https://wiki.manjaro.org/index.php?title=Burn_an_ISO_File#Writing_to_a_USB_Stick_in_Linux) that can be run by your computer. This file can be directly used by a virtual machine if you don't want to try out Manjaro on your actual computer, yet.
