This edition is supported by the Manjaro team and comes with KDE Plasma, a very modern and flexible desktop.

KDE Plasma is for people who want a user-friendly and customizable desktop. It is a feature-rich and versatile desktop environment that provides several different styles of menu to access applications. An excellent built-in interface to easily access and install new themes, widgets, etc, from the internet is also worth mentioning. KDE Plasma is simple by default, a clean work area for real-world usage which intends to stay out of your way, so the user is enabled to create the workflow that makes it more effective to complete tasks.
