Manjaro-Architect is a fork of the famous Architect Linux installer by Carl Duff, that has been modified to install Manjaro. It is a netinstaller that downloads the latest available packages, so your system is up to date right after installation, regardless of how old your install media is.

Manjaro-Architect offers total customization on your Manjaro installation:

- choose which Manjaro kernels you want to use, or multiple kernels.
- choose any Manjaro branch (stable, testing or unstable)
- choose your desktop from all current Manjaro editions, regardless of what install media you run the installer from. You can also install the base system only without graphical user interface.
- add any unconfigured desktop environment
- choose the default shell for user (bash, zsh or fish)
- choose your graphics drivers to be installed with mhwd
- choose extra packages to be installed
