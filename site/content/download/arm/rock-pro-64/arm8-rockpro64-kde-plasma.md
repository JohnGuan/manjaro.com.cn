KDE Plasma is for people who want a user-friendly and customizable desktop. It is a feature-rich and versatile desktop environment that provides several different styles of menu to access applications.

KDE Plasma is simple by default, a clean work area for real-world usage which intends to stay out of your way, so the user is enabled to create the workflow that makes it more effective to complete tasks.
