This edition is supported by the Manjaro ARM team and comes with Plasma desktop.

KDE is a feature-rich and versatile desktop environment that provides several different styles of menu to access applications. An excellent built-in interface to easily access and install new themes, widgets, etc, from the internet is also worth mentioning. While very user-friendly and certainly flashy, KDE is also quite resource heavy and noticably slower to start and use than a desktop environment such as XFCE. An Armv8 installation of Manjaro running KDE uses about 330 MB of memory.
