### Why does Manjaro ask for donations

Manjaro is not backed by a corporation and is solely held up by the Core Team and community volunteers. Some sponsors are willing to dedicate their time and resources to develop and improve Manjaro.

There are many ways you can help out Manjaro. One way is to donate a small amount of money, to help covering some costs, giving developers time and freedom to improve Manjaro's features or spreading the word by attending conferences.

### For what will my donations be used for

Servers are expensive. Your donation will be used to keep the website, forums, mailing lists and bugtracker up and running. It can also be used to attend conferences and provide resources to developers who dedicate their time and energy to improve Manjaro and carry it forward.

### Is my donation anonymous

Yes. We will keep everything you do anonymous. We won't share or publish any details about you and your donation.

### What do I get if I donate

You get a big THANK YOU from the Core Team, since contributions will keep the servers up and running and ensure the availability of updates and features within Manjaro.

### Why am I donating to a private person

Manjaro is not a registered organization, for now, as this is extremely expensive and Manjaro is a relatively young and growing distribution. Your donation will go to the leader of Manjaro's core team who will then pass it down to the right people.

### Can I get a tax deduction

Unfortunately not, as we are not a registered organization, which means your donation counts as private donation. For those the tax cannot be deducted.
