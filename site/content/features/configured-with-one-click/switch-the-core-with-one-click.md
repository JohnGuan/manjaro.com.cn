Power-users and people who need special features of the Linux Kernel that don't come with the default one can just switch to a different Kernel with one click. Do you make music or need other realtime features? Just switch to a RT-Kernel. Do you need the newest improved open-source graphics drivers? Just switch to a newer one. Manjaro let's you not only switch to another Kernel, but supports multiple installed kernels at the same time. Just re-boot your system and you can just switch between all installed Kernels in the boot menu.
