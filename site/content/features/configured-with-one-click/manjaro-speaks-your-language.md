If your native language isn't English, it's no problem for Manjaro. Just start our locale settings and select the language you want. After you logged out and in again, everything is exactly the way you want. We also offer you a special tool that automatically installs language packs for a variety of programs and notifies you if you can get translation sfor your favorite programs.
