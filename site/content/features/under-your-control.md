As like many other Linux distributions, we believe that privacy, security and keeping control are among the most valuable things for a user. We have included some clever tools to accomplish everything needed to make room for actual work, entertainment and relaxation. But you, the user, will always be in control of your own computer. It's your hardware and your operating system.
