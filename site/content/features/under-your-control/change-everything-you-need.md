Every person is different and needs an operating system that will not try to enforce a specific workflow, visual style or certain programs. Manjaro comes with defaults, we think to suit most of users. But as most other Linux distributions, we keep all options open configure, change, remove or replace all functions. Most of these options are directly available via a easy-to-use configuration program that helps changing things.
