Manjaro only shows a small notification if an update is available. If you have important work to do, are currently in a ranked game or watching a movie, you won't even notice it or can just hide it with one click. "Not now" still means that you don't have time and don't want to update right now. There are no hidden downloads or automatic restarts. Manjaro does exactly what you want.
