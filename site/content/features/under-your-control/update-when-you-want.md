Manjaro only shows a small notification if an update is available. If you have important work to do, are currently in a ranked game or currently watching a movie, you won't even notice it or just can hide it with one click. "Not now" still means that you don't have time and just don't want to update now. No hidden downloads, no automatic restarts. Manjaro does exactly what you want.
