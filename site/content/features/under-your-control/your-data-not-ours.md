Manjaro does not send unwanted data to anybody. Why should it? It's your data and you decide what you want to do with it. **You** can decide if you want to use services that finance themselves with the data you generate. But you also can decide to secure, hide and protect your data and use open source software that is directly available in Manjaro's repositories and has been additionally checked by the package maintainer.
