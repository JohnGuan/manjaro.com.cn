Our **Bladebook** is a 13.3" Intel Quad Core 1.3 kg light-weight Laptop optimized for Manjaro Linux, featuring the Intel® Celeron® Processor J3455 (Apollo Lake) with a burst frequency up to 2.30 GHz. It comes with 6 GB DDR3L and a built-in 256 GB SSD. This results in a 20% to 30% stronger CPU performance than with the original spec we had back in Fall 2018. We changed the screen to an IPS panel with 1920x1080 resolution and upped the WIFI to a dual frequency 2.4G + 5G band.

For simplicity we have a full size keyboard in US QWERTY layout, with 15mm large keycap, 1.8mm keypitch and 30% touchpad area, which results in a seamless island type keyboard. On the connection front we have a headphone/mic 2-in-1, 2x USB 3.0 slots, SDHC cardslot and mini HDMI connector.

We will ship the **Bladebook** with pre-installed Manjaro from Denmark by our partner shop to most countries within the EU. To get more information about the bladebook please [mail us](mailto:info-bladebook@manjaro.org) or visit the [FCS shop](https://linux-aarhus.dk/en/vare/manjaro-bladebook/).
