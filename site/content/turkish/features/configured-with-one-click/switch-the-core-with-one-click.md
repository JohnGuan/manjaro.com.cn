Power-users and people who need special features of the Linux Kernel that don't come with the default one, can just switch to a different Kernel with one click. Do you make music or need other realtime features? Just switch to an RT-Kernel. Do you need the newest improved open-source graphics drivers? Just switch to a newer one. Manjaro supports multiple installed Kernels at the same time. Just re-boot your system and make your selection in the boot menu.
