            <h3>What is Linux?</h3>
            <p>Linux is the name of the kernel powering the GNU system. GNU/Linux, also called Linux, is a free and open-source operating system, meaning that you may freely use and freely distribute it.</p>
            <p>Originally developed in 1991 by Finnish Programmer Linus Torvalds, Linux is an exceptionally robust and reliable kernel, which combined with the GNU system is most commonly used for Internet servers, mobile phones/tablets (e.g. Android). Additionally, the use of GNU/Linux as an alternative operating system, for personal computers such as desktops or laptops, has also been growing over the years, with several million users having already discovered the benefits of it.
            </p>
            <h3>What are the benefits of using Linux?</h3>
            <p>There are quite a few, GNU/Linux is free to use, highly efficient, and very fast. The 64 bit version of Manjaro with the Xfce desktop, boots up in only a few seconds, it uses only 200MB of memory to run.</p>
            <p>Linux systems are also very secure, and are not affected by the huge amount of Windows viruses, trojans, worms, or malware out there. Anti-virus software is not required. And as for the tens of thousands of software applications available, including fully compatible equivalents of popular Windows software such as MS Office, these are also completely free.</p>
            <p>It is also possible to easily run many popular Windows applications on GNU/Linux using compatibility software such as Wine or PlayonLinux or using Proton via Steam. The examples given here are far from comprehensive!
