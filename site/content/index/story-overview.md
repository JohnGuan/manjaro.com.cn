Manjaro is an accessible, friendly, open-source Linux distribution and community. Based on [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/), Manjaro provides all the benefits of cutting-edge software combined with a focus on getting started quickly, automated tools to require less manual intervention, and help readily available when needed. Manjaro is suitable for both newcomers and experienced Linux users.


Manjaro is an excellent entry-point into the Linux world. Unlike proprietary operating systems, Manjaro gives you full control over your hardware, without restrictions. This makes it ideal for people who want to learn how Linux works and how it is different to other operating systems. From this perspective, Manjaro is suitable for beginners similar to the way an Arduino is an excellent entry-point to embedded hardware development.


Manjaro is not a consumer-oriented operating system. You have full control and you will not be prevented from breaking your own installation - but then again, breaking things and fixing them is half of the fun! On the other hand, if you are happy with the way it works you don't have to change a thing.


Manjaro can represent a perfect middle-ground for experienced Linux users, those who want good performance, full control, and cutting-edge software but also a degree of software version stability.

### <i class="fa fa-dollar-sign"></i> Free is better

Manjaro always will be completely free. We create it, so we can have a Linux based operating system that is easy to use and stable, you the user, are the main focus, we do not take control away from you and consider privacy very important, we do not keep, sell or pass your data to 3rd parties.

### <i class="fa fa-download"></i> Install Anything

There are thousands of software applications available in the software center, including fully compatible equivalents of popular Windows software such as MS Office, any additional software is also completely free. Searching for applications to install on the internet, is not necessary.

### <i class="fa fa-users"></i>Great Community

We have a polite, friendly and cheerful [Forum](https://forum.manjaro.org/), everyone is welcoming and supportive. The forum is the right place to share knowledge, talk Linux with the community, we all <i class="fa fa-heart"></i> it.

### <i class="fas fa-compact-disc"></i>Availability

Manjaro is Available for 64 Bit architecture, [Gnome](https://www.gnome.org/gnome-3/), and [XFCE](https://www.xfce.org/) [editions](/download/) are officially supported, other flavors are community maintained, so as 32 Bit and ARM architectures.

ARM is available as per device basis, pre built images can be downloaded for the Raspberry Pi and Pinebook 64.

### <i class="fab fa-linux"></i>What is Linux

[Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) is the name of the kernel powering the GNU system. GNU/Linux, also called Linux is a free and [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) operating system, that can be freely used and distributed.

Originally developed in 1991 by Finnish Programmer [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds), Linux is an exceptionally robust and reliable kernel, which combined with the GNU system is most commonly used for Internet servers, mobile phones, tablets mostly known as [Android](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)) devices. Additionally, the use of GNU/Linux as an alternative operating system, for personal computers such as desktops or laptops, has also been growing over the years, with several million users having already discovered the benefits of it.

### <i class="fab fa-linux"></i>Benefits of using Linux

It is highly efficient, very fast and any hardware device works out of the box, only in rare occasions you will need to install a device driver, The 64 bit version of Manjaro with the Xfce desktop, boots up in only a few seconds, it uses only 200MB of memory to run.

Linux systems are also very secure, and are not affected by the huge amount of Windows viruses, trojans, worms, or malware out there. Anti-virus software is not required.

It is also possible to easily run many popular Windows applications on GNU/Linux using compatibility software such as [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/) or [PlayonLinux](https://www.playonlinux.com/) or using [Proton](https://www.protondb.com/) via [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/about/). The examples given here are far from comprehensive!
