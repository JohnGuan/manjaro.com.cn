Manjaro comes preinstalled with [Steam](https://steampowered.com), so there's no need to go to a website and download it manually. Installing drivers, updates and more applications is handled through the package manager and [Manjaro Hardware Detection Tool](https://wiki.manjaro.org/index.php/Manjaro_Hardware_Detection) that will do all operations in just a couple of minutes and never requires or forces a restart of the system.

Due to the design of Linux, hardware like Gamepads are recognized instantaneously if drivers are available, so users don't have to wait until it works.

Included in the package repositories is software like [Teamspeak 3](http://teamspeak.com/), [Mumble](https://www.mumble.info/) or [Skype](https://www.skype.com/). Games like the strategy game [0 A.D.](http://play0ad.com/) or the sandbox-game [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/), including mods and custom launchers like [MultiMC](http://multimc.org/), [Feed the Beast](http://feed-the-beast.com/) or [MCEdit](http://www.mcedit.net/) are directly available via Manjaro's repositories or the Arch User Repository (AUR).

For people who want to play old games or games from different platforms or operating systems, the latest versions of emulators or runtimes like [Doxbox](https://www.dosbox.com/), [Dolphin](http://www.dolphin-emulator.com/) or [WINE](https://www.winehq.org/) are also available in the package repositories and can be installed with just a few clicks.
