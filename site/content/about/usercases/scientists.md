Manjaro's repositories contain the newest available versions of popular software like the statistic language [R](https://www.r-project.org/), the numerical computational package [Scilab](http://www.scilab.org/), and the scripting language [Python](https://www.python.org/) and more. Also [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/), additional packages for it and software like [Lyx](https://www.lyx.org/) or [TeXstudio](http://www.texstudio.org/) is readily available and can be installed with just few clicks. With LaTeX scientists can create high-quality documents and presentations with included math-forumulas, chemical molecules, self-updating cross- and literature references and more without being restrained by a specific style or document type. Lyx encapsulates LaTeX in a friendly GUI for people who don't have much experience with LaTeX.

Additional modules for R, Python, [Perl](https://www.perl.org/) and others are either available directly through Manjaro's repositories or can be compiled and installed with programs like [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) or the integrated package management of R.

No additional software is need as all needed build-tools are pre-installed. Experimental data can be analyzed with [LabPlot](https://www.kde.org/applications/education/labplot/).

The repositories are extended further by the Arch User Repository (AUR), that contains build-scripts that generate packages. Included is [Yaourt](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Yaourt) that handles the building, installing and updating of AUR-packages with an easy-to-use command line interface. Software available in the AUR are for example [popular libraries](https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-mkl), [compilers](https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-compilers), tools for bioinformatics like the [Vienna RNA](https://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA/) package or IDE like [R-Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/).
