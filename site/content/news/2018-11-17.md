## [Stable Update] 2018-11-17 - Kernels, Mesa, Palemoon

Hi community,

Welcome to another **stable** update. So what do we have with this one?

- We updated most of our **Kernels**
- **Palemoon** is at [28.2.0](http://www.palemoon.org/releasenotes.shtml)
- **Mesa** is at [18.2.5](https://www.mesa3d.org/relnotes/18.2.5.html)

We hope with all these changes Manjaro to be more efficient for you all. Please review, as most likely I'll move **testing** packages to our **stable** branch later today.
