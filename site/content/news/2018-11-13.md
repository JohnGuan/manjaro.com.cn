Hi community,

Welcome to another **stable** update. So what do we have with this one?

- We added Simon's [Primary Display Support](https://simon.shimmerproject.org/2018/11/12/adventures-in-primary-display-land/) to XFCE 4.13
- **Flatpak** got updated
- We fixed most of the reported issues in **Cinnamon**
- More updates for **Deepin** got added
- **Tesseract** is now at [v4.0](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/releases/tag/4.0.0)
- **KDE Framework** is now at [5.52.0](https://www.kde.org/announcements/kde-frameworks-5.52.0.php)
- The usual upstream rebuilds/updates

We hope with all these changes Manjaro to be more efficient for you all. Please review, as most likely I'll move **testing** packages to our **stable** branch later today.
