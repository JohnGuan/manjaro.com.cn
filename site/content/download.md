Thank you for trying Manjaro Linux, you are awesome.

XFCE, KDE and GNOME are our flagship editions. If you want to try other DE's (Desktop Enviroments), our community has created many flavours.

How to create a [bootable USB-Stick](https://manjaro.org/support/firststeps/#making-a-live-system).

Some DE's are aimed at giving a modern user experience by breaking away from decades old interface standards, while others try to be more traditional. Certain environments focus on resource efficiency and like that may be the best choice for older computers.

For past releases check our archives on [flagship](https://osdn.net/projects/manjaro/storage) and [community](https://osdn.net/projects/manjaro-community/storage) Editions.
