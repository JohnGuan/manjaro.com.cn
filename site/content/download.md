For simplicity we have selected XFCE, KDE and GNOME as our flagship editions. If you want to look for other experiences, our community has created many flavours that focus around other desktops.

Some desktops are very resource-efficient and makes them a good choice for *old computers*. Others focus on breaking away from user interface standards, that are decades old, giving a modern experience. There is also the traditional desktop experience.

For past releases check our archives on [flagship](https://osdn.net/projects/manjaro/storage) and [community](https://osdn.net/projects/manjaro-community/storage) Editions.
